# enrichingRE

The repository associated with the paper "Enriching Relation Extraction with OpenIE" where we examine the impact of recent OpenIE techniques on the task of RE by converting information about sentence components like subjects, objects, verbs, and adverbials into vector representations. Our hypothesis is that breaking down complex sentences into smaller parts through OpenIE enhances the performance of context-aware language models like BERT in RE. Results from testing on two annotated datasets, KnowledgeNet and FewRel, show improved accuracy with our enriched models compared to current RE methods. Our best scores were 92% F1 on KnowledgeNet and 71% F1 on FewRel, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach on these benchmark datasets. Both datasets are publicly available, KnowledgeNet at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diffbot/knowledge-net/master/dataset/train.json and FewRel at https://github.com/fractalego/fewrel_zero_shot/tree/master/data
At the moment, a snippet of the code is available for reproducibility purposes. The train and test sets (i.e. the preprocessed datasets broken down into clauses for fine-tuning) are released under the folder data. Those are small subsets of the original data. In terms of reproducibility, we used OpenIE5 https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone to break down the sentences into clauses for KnowledgeNet and we used OpenIE6 https://github.com/dair-iitd/openie6 for FewRel.
