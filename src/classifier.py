class Classifier(object):
    r"""
    Data Collator classification task.

    It uses a given tokenizer and label encoder to convert any text and labels to numbers that
    can go straight into a pretrained model.

    This class is built for reusability: it can be used as is as long
    as the `dataloader` outputs a batch in dictionary format that can be passed
    straight into the model - `model(**batch)`.

    Arguments:

      use_tokenizer (:obj:`transformers.tokenization_?`):
          Transformer type tokenizer used to process raw text into numbers.

      labels_ids (:obj:`dict`):
          Dictionary to encode any labels names into numbers. Keys map to
          labels names and Values map to number associated to those labels.

      max_sequence_len (:obj:`int`, `optional`)
          Value to indicate the maximum desired sequence to truncate or pad text
          sequences. If no value is passed it will used maximum sequence size
          supported by the tokenizer and model.

        This function allows the class object to be used as a function call.
        Since the PyTorch DataLoader needs a collator function, I can use this
        class as a function.

        Arguments:

          item (:obj:`list`):
              List of texts and labels.

        Returns:
          :obj:`Dict[str, object]`: Dictionary of inputs that feed into the model.
          It holddes the statement `model(**Returned Dictionary)`.
